# coral-reef-health-detection-using-yolo-v3-and-GAN-augumented-dataset

Problem Statement

To automate monitoring and  detect the coral reefs affected by multiple diseases due to the stress and variation in heat under the impact of the ocean.

Motivation: Coral reefs are some of the most diverse ecosystems in the world and Corals reefs contribute for 50-80% of oxygen in ocean

Scope:

To train a model to increase the size of the dataset.

To select a appropriate algorithm for object detection.

To classify the corals as healthy and bleached.
